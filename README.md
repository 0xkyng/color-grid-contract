# ColorGrid Smart Contract

The ColorGrid smart contract is a creative Ethereum-based project that generates a visually appealing 5x7 grid of cells, each assigned a color based on a random seed. This contract allows users to explore and query the colors of individual cells within the grid.

## Features

- Randomly assigns colors to grid cells using a seed generated from block data and user input.
- Provides a visually pleasing and consistent color pattern across the grid.
- Users can query the color of any cell within the grid.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before interacting with the ColorGrid smart contract, ensure you have the following:

- An Ethereum wallet and some Ether for transactions.
- Knowledge of how to interact with Ethereum smart contracts (using tools like Remix, Truffle, or web3.js).

### Interacting with the Contract

1. Deploy the `ColorGrid` smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Once deployed, call the `setColors` function to generate the color pattern for the grid. This function uses a random seed generated from block data and user input.
3. After generating the colors, you can use the `getColor(uint x, uint y)` function to query the color of a specific cell within the grid by providing its coordinates `(x, y)` as arguments.
4. Remember to respect the grid boundaries by ensuring that `x` is less than 7 and `y` is less than 5 when calling the `getColor` function.

### Example

```solidity
- Deploy the ColorGrid contract

- Call setColors to generate the color pattern
ColorGrid.setColors();

- Query the color of a specific cell
uint color = ColorGrid.getColor(2, 3);
```

Certainly! Here's a well-structured README in Markdown format for your ColorGrid smart contract:
